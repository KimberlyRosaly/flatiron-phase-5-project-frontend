Hi.
<br>
My name is Kim and I am in love with code.
<br>
I am also in love with art.
<br>
<br>
Here, you will find my attempt to gather my two loves into one world of development. This application strives to show off my own artwork along with the artwork ( and information ) of other cherished artists that I soulfully support. Hopefully, you enjoy this!
<br>
<br>

<div align="right">♥Love always,
-Kim</div>
